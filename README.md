Startup for cs 260

My idea for this is a sort of outfit creator for a video game like Breath of the Wild. You can switch between all pieces of armor (and color) to see how the combinations look. If you like one, you can add it to you "closet". Which can also post it publicly. Other users can like your outfits. You will get a notification if someone likes your outfit.
