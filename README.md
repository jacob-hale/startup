Mood tracker

A simple tracker than alerts you everyday to make an entry. "How are you feeling today?" The user then responds with an emoji and can add an optional note for the day.
A calender view is presented allowing the user to see their mood over a month or week at a time.

There would be a login feature and other people would be able to see the emoji you selected for the day. 
If you select any emoji other than the happy one, they can give you some love by pressing a heart and the you will get notified real time, "John gave you some love!".

Elevator Pitch:
Imagine a simple app that asks you one question every day: “How are you feeling today?” With just a tap, choose an emoji to reflect your mood and optionally jot down a quick note. 
The app organizes your entries into a beautiful calendar view, so you can spot trends and reflect on your emotional journey.

But here’s the twist: other people, friends and strangers, can see your emoji for the day. If you’re feeling anything less than happy, they can send you a little extra love with a heart. 
You’ll instantly get a notification saying, “John gave you some love!” It’s a gentle way to share your feelings, stay connected, and get a boost when you need it most.

Start building an emotional support circle while gaining insights into your own well-being one emoji at a time.
